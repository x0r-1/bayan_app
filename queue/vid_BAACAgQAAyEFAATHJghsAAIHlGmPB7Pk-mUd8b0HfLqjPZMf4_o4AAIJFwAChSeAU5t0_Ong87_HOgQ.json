  "video_title": "Look at those who have less than you, and you’ll be reminded of the countless blessings Allah has bestowed upon you. When feelings of overwhelm or ingratitude arise, shift your focus to those with fewer possessions, fewer comforts, and fewer opportunities. You’ll find your heart softening with gratitude for what you have. Many in our generation often complain about what they lack, forgetting that others long for the very things they possess. Let us not forget to appreciate Allah’s blessings, which are too numerous to count. By focusing on His grace, you’ll find peace and contentment in your heart. And ˹remember˺ when your Lord proclaimed, “If you are grateful, I will certainly give you more.” [Quran-14:7] 🤲 🌸 🌟",
