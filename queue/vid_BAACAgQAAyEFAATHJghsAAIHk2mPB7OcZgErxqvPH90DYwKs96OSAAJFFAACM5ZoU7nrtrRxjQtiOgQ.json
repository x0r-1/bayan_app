  "video_title": "How can we claim to love Allah Almighty while disobeying Him? True love for Allah is not in mere words, but in actions. If your love for Him is sincere, it will reflect in your obedience to His commands. Just as the lover is obedient to the one they love, let your heart’s devotion be shown through your submission to Allah. Love without obedience is just a claim. Let your actions speak the truth of your love for Him. 🤲🤍",
