Whatever state you are in, whether in pain or joy, know that you are in the mercy of Allah. If you endure hardship, it is for the forgiveness of your sins and the elevation of your rank. If you are in joy, it is a gift from Allah. \"Glory be to You, my Lord, for You have always been kind to me” 🌙🇸🇦✨",
