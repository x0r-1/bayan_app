  "video_title": "The most beautiful enjoyment in my life is worshipping Allah in solitude. Peace fills my heart when I spread my prayer mat in the quiet of the night, away from the world's chaos. In those moments, it's just me and my Creator. I pour out my heart, seeking comfort through His remembrance. Each prayer, each tear brings me closer to Him. My burdens lift, replaced by peace and connection. No matter how broken I feel, Allah's mercy and love give me strength and hope. This time with my Lord is the sweetest escape and greatest blessing. For me, Allah is greater than everything, and He alone is sufficient for me. ✨",
