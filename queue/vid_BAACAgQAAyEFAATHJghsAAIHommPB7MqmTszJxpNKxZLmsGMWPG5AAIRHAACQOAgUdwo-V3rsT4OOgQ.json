  "video_title": "Even in what feels bitter, there is a sweetness Allah has hidden that you cannot yet see. Sometimes He gives you something your heart calls beautiful, and sometimes He gives you what seems difficult or even painful. But by the will of Allah, nothing He gives is void of goodness. Be patient. Be grateful. Trust that the hardship you carry today is only here to shape you, not to break you. One day, you will look back and see how the weight turned into a gift, how the trial became a doorway to ease, and how the bitterness you once felt became the sweetest chapter in your story. Gratitude makes what you have feel like enough, and patience turns what you endure into something beautiful.",
