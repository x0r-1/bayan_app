  "video_title": "Sometimes all you need is certainty—like the certainty of Musa (peace be upon him) as the sea stood before him and Pharaoh’s army behind him. While his people cried out in fear, he said with unwavering trust, “No! Indeed, my Lord is with me. He will guide me.” And like the calm certainty of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), sitting in the cave with Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him), saying, “What do you think of two, when Allah is the third of them?” When you carry that level of trust, fear loses its grip. So say from your heart: O Allah, fill my heart with that kind of yaqīn (certainty). 🌟🌟 🌟🌟🌟🌟",
