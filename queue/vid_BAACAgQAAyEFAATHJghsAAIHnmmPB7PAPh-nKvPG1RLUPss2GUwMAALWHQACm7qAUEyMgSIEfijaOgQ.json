  "video_title": "How can we blame the wind for shaking our hearts, when we left our doors open to every storm? How can we mourn the silence of the night, when we've stopped whispering to Allah before dawn? How can we feel empty in a world full of signs, when we rarely pause to see what He's written in the sky? How can we chase love in broken places, and forget the One who heals hearts without touch? How can we ask why we feel distant, when our Qur'an gathers dust on the shelf? How can we cry for peace in our chaos, yet miss the sujood that quiets the soul? How can we complain the path is dark, when we closed our eyes to the Light of guidance? How can we fear the future so deeply, when Al-Wakeel is already writing it with mercy? How can we ache for what was never meant, and ignore the Duas that went unanswered for our protection? How can we doubt His timing, when every delay was a gentle redirection? How can we forget Jannah, when every tear in dunya is counted with reward? How can we feel unloved, when Ar-Rahman loves us more than 70 mothers combined? 🌟🌟 🌟🌟🌟",
