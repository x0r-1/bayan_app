  "video_title": "In the last ten nights of Ramadan, the Night of Qadr awaits—a night better than a thousand months. It is a time to seek Allah’s mercy and forgiveness with sincere prayer and faith. As the Prophet (ﷺ) said, “Whoever stands in prayer on the Night of Qadr with faith and seeking reward, his past sins will be forgiven.” In this blessed time, when Allah’s mercy is abundant, do not miss the opportunity to ask, for He is always ready to answer. Make this night count, for it holds the potential for transformation and endless blessings 🤍🤲🤎🤲🌙",
