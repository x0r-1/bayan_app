  "video_title": "Sometimes your heart trembles with fear for what’s ahead, and lingers on what’s behind. You stay awake over what may or may not come. But remember… the One who was enough for you yesterday will not abandon you tomorrow. Worry cannot change what Allah has decreed, yet surrendering to Him brings unmatched peace. To truly know Allah is to trust Him in every uncertainty, to rest in His wisdom, and to feel His presence guiding you through every trial. “And put your trust in Allah, for Allah is sufficient as a Trustee of Affairs.” [Quran-33:3] Your Lord’s sufficiency is greater than any fear, and His care over your life is beyond what your heart can imagine. ❤️‍🩹",
