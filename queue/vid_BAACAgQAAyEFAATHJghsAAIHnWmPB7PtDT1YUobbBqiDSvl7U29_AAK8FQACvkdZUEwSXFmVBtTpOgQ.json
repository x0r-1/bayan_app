  "video_title": "We need to understand how to guide our children with wisdom and intention. Our focus should be entirely on them—their growth, their character, and their future. The Salaf (righteous predecessors) advised us to divide a child’s upbringing into three distinct stages: The first seven years are for love and play. During this time, we should focus on bonding with our children, enjoying their presence, and letting them enjoy ours. This is the stage where they are most adorable, curious, and open-hearted. Our love and play lay the foundation for a strong, trusting relationship. The next seven years are for teaching. This is when we instill manners (adab), discipline, and the purpose of life. It is a crucial time to teach them the values of Islam—not just through words, but through our actions. We must help them live Islam, not just learn about it. Our goal is to nurture character, spirituality, and a sense of responsibility. The final stage—the years after teaching—is when we become their close companions. If we have invested the right effort and sincerity in the earlier stages, we will find that our children trust us, seek our advice, and consider us their best friends. Raising righteous children is one of the most important ways to uplift this Ummah. It requires sacrifice, patience, and vision—but the rewards, in this life and the next, are immeasurable. 🌟🧕🌟",
