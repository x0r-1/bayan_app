  "video_title": "We see the trials that reach us and we question them. We ask, \"Why is this happening to me?\" But we never stop to think about what Allah protected us from that we don't even know about. Ibn al-Qayyim رحمه الله said if the unseen were uncovered for us, if Allah showed us all the harm He diverted from our lives, our souls would melt in love and gratitude for Him. Just think about that. How many disasters never reached you? How many losses never touched you? How many pains were stopped before they ever came close? You don't know. I don't know. But Allah عزوجل does. And He protected us from all of it. That's why we say Alhamdulillah. Not just for what we see, but for what we don't. Not just for the blessings we know, but for the ones we'll never know about. So say it today. Say it now. Mean it. Feel it: Alhamdulillah for everything. 🤍",
