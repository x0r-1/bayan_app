  "video_title": "No one holds your provision. No one controls your fate. If the tyrant al-Ḥajjāj once threatened, “What if we hasten you to the Fire?” — the believer replied with certainty, “If I knew that was in your hands, I would’ve taken you as a god.” But it’s not in their hands. Just as your sustenance is not in the hands of people. They cannot cut off your rizq, even if they tried — because Ar-Razzāq, The Ultimate Provider, is Allah alone. So walk through life with that confidence, not arrogance — a quiet trust that what is meant for you will reach you, and what isn’t will pass you by. Your job is to strive. Their words hold no weight. His decree is everything.",
