  "video_title": "When you carry the certainty that life is a test—through both ease and hardship—your heart begins to see beyond the surface. You become patient when things fall apart, grateful when blessings pour in, and steady in every storm. Because you know: everything is written. Nothing escapes the knowledge of Allah. So don’t panic. Don’t chase what was never yours. Don’t despair. If you stay mindful of Him, He will anchor you—the One who protects, provides, and accounts for every soul. Walk with trust. That’s how hearts survive. 🇸🇦 🤲",
