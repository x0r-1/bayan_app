  "video_title": "Sometimes what we see as loss, delay, or disappointment is actually the perfect decree from Allah Almighty. Allah had already written it as good for us. Every closed door, every missed opportunity, every path that did not lead where we hoped is good for us, even if we cannot see it in the moment. Trust in His wisdom. Accept His decree with gratitude. What feels like a setback today may turn into the greatest blessing tomorrow. What seems bitter may carry the sweetest wisdom. Surrender your heart to His plan, for Allah knows what we do not, and every destiny He has set is filled with goodness. Remember to say: Alhamdulillah, perhaps this is good. 🤲🏽❤️‍🩹❤️",
